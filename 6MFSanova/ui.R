<li> Your data contain several separate factor groups shown in 2 vectors</li>
<li> One vector is the observed values; one vector is to mark your values in different factor groups</li>
<li> The separate factor groups are independent and identically approximately normally distributed</li>
<li> Each mean of the factor group follows a normal distribution with the same variance and can be compared</li>
</ul>

<h4><i>Case Example</i></h4>
<i>Suppose we want to find whether passive smoking had a measurable effect on the incidence of cancer. In a study, we studied 6 group of smokers: nonsmokers (NS), passive smokers (PS), non-inhaling smokers (NI), light smokers (LS), moderate smokers (MS), and heavy smokers (HS).
The study measured the forced mid-expiatory flow (FEF). We wanted to the know the FEF differences among the 6 groups.

<h4><i>Case Example</i></h4>
<i>Suppose we were interested in the effects of sex and 3 dietary groups on SBP.
The 3 dietary groups included strict vegetarians (SV), lactovegentarians (LV), and normal (NOR) people, and we tested the SBP.
The effects of sex and and dietary group might be related (interact) with each other.
We wanted to know the effect of dietary group and sex on the SBP and whether the two factors were related with each other.
