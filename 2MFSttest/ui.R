<i><h4>Case Example</h4>
Suppose we collected the age of 50 independent lymph node-positive patients and wanted to know whether the general age of lymph node-positive patients was 50 years old

Suppose we collected the age of 50 independent lymph node-positive patients. Among them, 25 had Estrogen receptor (ER) positive, 25 had ER negative.
We wanted to know if the ages of patients with ER positive was significantly different from patients with ER negative in general. Or, whether ER is related to age.

<h4><i>Case Example</i></h4>

This was a paired case. We wanted to know whether the sleeping hours before and after the drug would be significantly different; or, whether the difference before and after were significantly different from 0</i>
