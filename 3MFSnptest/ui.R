<p>This method is an alternative to a one-sample t-test when the data cannot be assumed to be normally distributed.
This method is based on the ranks of observations rather than on their actual values</p>

<h4><b> 1. Functionalities  </b></h4>
<ul>
<li> To determine if the median/location of the population from which your data is drawn statistically significantly different from the specified median</li>
<li> To know the basic descriptive statistics about your data</li>
<li> To know the descriptive statistics plot such as box-plot, distribution histogram, and density distribution plot about your data</li>
</ul>

<h4><b> 2. About your data </b></h4>

<ul>
<li> Your data contain only 1 group of values (or 1 numeric vector)</li>
<li> Your data are meaningful to measure the distance from the specified median</li>
<li> The values are independent observations</li>
<li> No assumption on the distributional shape of your data, which means your data may be not normally distributed</li>
</ul>

<h4><i>Case Example</i></h4>
<i>Suppose we collected the Depression Rating Scale (DRS) measurements of 9 patients from a particular group of patients. DRS Scale > 1 indicated Depression.
We wanted to know if the DRS of patients was significantly greater than 1.
</i>
<h4> Please follow the <b>Steps</b>, and <b>Outputs</b> will give real-time analytical results.</h4>

<b>In the paired case, we compare the differences between 2 groups to zero. Thus, it becomes a one-sample test problem.</b>

<ul>
<li>  One person's pre-test and post-test scores</li>
<li>  When two samples have been matched or paired</li>

<h4><i>Case Example</i></h4>
