<li> To determine if the population rate/proportion behind your data is significantly different from the specified rate/proportion</li>
<li> To determine how compatible the sample rate/proportion with a population rate/proportion</li>
<li> To determine the probability of success in a Bernoulli experiment</li>
</ul>

<h4><b> 2. About your data </b></h4>

<h4><i>Case Example</i></h4>
<i>Suppose that in the general population, 20% of women who had infertility. Suppose a treatment may affect infertility. 200 women who were trying to get pregnant accepted the treatment.
Among 40 women who got the treatment, 10 were still infertile. We wanted to know if there was a significant difference in the rate of infertility among treated women compared to 20% of the general infertile rate.

Also, we investigated 10245 no breast cancer women as control. Among them, 1498 had at least one birth after 30 years old.
We wanted to know if the underlying probability of having first birth over 30 years old was different in breast cancer and non-breast cancer groups.

Then, we categorize women into different age groups. 
We wanted to know if the probability of having cancer were different among different age groups; or if their ages related to breast cancer.
