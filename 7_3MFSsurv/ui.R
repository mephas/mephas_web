<h4><b> 1. What you can do on this page  </b></h4>
<ul>
<li> To get your data prepared for survival models
<li> To change the type of some variables for linear regression model
<li> To get the basic descriptive statistics of the variables in your data
<li> To get the descriptive statistics plot of the variables in your data
</ul>

<h4><b> 2. About your data </b></h4>

<ul>
<li> Your data need to include one binary dependent variable (outcome/response) as Y (Y=1/0, or a 2-level factor), and >=1 independent variables (factors/predictors)
<li> Your data need to have more rows than columns
<li> Do not mix character and numbers in the same column 
<li> The data used to build model is called <b>training data</b>
</ul> 

<i><h4>Case Example</h4>
Suppose we wanted to explore the Breast Cancer dataset and develop a model to try classifying suspected cells to Benign (B) or Malignant (M).

<h4> Please follow the <b>Steps</b>, and <b>Outputs</b> will give real-time analytical results. After getting data ready, please find the model in the next tabs.</h4>

<p> The Kaplanâ€“Meier estimator, also known as the product limit estimator, is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival function from lifetime data. </p>

<h4><b> 1. What you can do on this page  </b></h4>
<ul>
<li> To get Kaplan-Meier survival curves, based on the survival time and censored data
<li> To conduct log Log-rank test to compare the survival distributions of two samples
<li> To get fitted values which are predicted from the existed data
</ul>
