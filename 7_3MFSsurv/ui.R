<h4><b> 1. What you can do on this page  </b></h4>
<ul>
<li> To upload data file, preview data set, and check the correctness of data input 
<li> To pre-process some variables (when necessary) for building the model
<li> To get the basic descriptive statistics and plots of the variables
<li> To prepare the survival object as 'dependent variable' for building model
</ul>

<h4><b> 2. About your data (training set)</b></h4>

<ul>
<li> Your data need to include <b>one survival time variable and one 1/0 censoring variable</b> and <b> at least one independent variables (denoted as X)</b>
<li> Your data need to have more rows than columns
<li> Do not mix character and numbers in the same column 
<li> The data used to build model is called <b>training set</b>
</ul> 

<i><h4>Case Example</h4>

Suppose we wanted to explore 100 lymph node positive breast cancer patients on metastasis-free survival. 
Data contained 5 clinical risk factors: (1) Diam: diameter of the tumor; (2) N: number of affected lymph nodes; (3) ER: estrogen receptor status; (4) Grade: grade of the tumor; and (5) Age: Patient age at diagnosis (years); 
and gene expression measurements of 70 genes found to be prognostic for metastasis-free survival in an earlier study. 
Time variable is metastasis-free follow-up time (months). Censoring indicator variable: 1 = metastasis or death; 0 = censored.

<p> <b>Kaplanâ€“Meier estimator</b>, also known as the product limit estimator, is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival function from lifetime data. </p>
<p> <b>Log-rank test</b> is a hypothesis test to compare the survival distributions of two samples. It compares estimates of the hazard functions of the two groups at each observed event time.

<h4><b> 1. What you can do on this page  </b></h4>
<ul>
<li> To get Kaplan-Meier survival probability estimate
<li> To get Kaplan-Meier survival curves, cumulative events distribution curves, and cumulative hazard curves by group variable
<li> To conduct log-rank test to compare the survival curves from 2 groups
<li> To conduct pairwise log-rank test to compare the survival curves from more than two groups
</ul>

<h4><b> 2. About your data </b></h4>

<ul>
<li> The independent variable is categorical
<li> Please prepare the survival object in the Data tab
